# Code of conduct for contributors

1. Don't be a jerk.
2. Read the contribution guidelines.
3. Respect is not just a song by Aretha Franklin. Show it to other contributors and the repository maintainer.
4. All competent contributions are welcome. We welcome contributors from all universes, including Vulcan computer scientists, Jakku code scavengers, Ravenclaws algorithm spell-writers, Gondorian full-stone-stack engineers, or Time Lord TARDIS debuggers.
5. See #1.
